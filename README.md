# Contacts WPF
This is my exam project. The project was written when I was studying at `ITStep Academy`
> Program works only on Windows

Written in `C#` used by `WPF`

This is a `desktop contacts program`. Just like a regular app, it can store people's `phone numbers`, `information` and `mail`. You can <kbd>add</kbd>, <kbd>edit</kbd> and <kbd>delete</kbd> contacts.
